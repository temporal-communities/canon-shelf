# »Dramenlexikon des 18. Jahrhunderts«
*(= »Encyclopedia of 18th-Century Drama«)*

The »Dramenlexikon des 18. Jahrhunderts«, edited by Heide Hollmer and Albert Meier and published in 2001, constitutes a single-volume reference work comprising entries on 250 German-language dramatic works by 108 authors, with original publication dates ranging from 1700 to 1800. (The list actually comprises 251 works, one of which is a fictitious entry, try to find it!)

The compendium endeavors to represent the breadth and diversity of 18th-century dramatic production beyond the canonical works of authors who retain prominence in contemporary literary historiography, such as Gottsched, Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller. While the collection still exhibits canonical characteristics, the editors acknowledge certain methodological constraints in their selection criteria: »The primary criterion for selection is the representativeness of the work: either because of its contemporary success or as evidence of a genre that was popular at the time or an original formal experiment« (preface, pp. 5–6). Each entry provides a plot synopsis, interpretation notes, and critical assessment within one to three pages. (Description adapted from the [German Wikipedia article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramenlexikon_des_18._Jahrhunderts).)

The present dataset represents a transformation of the encyclopedia into a machine-readable format, enriched with standardised metadata for authors and works (Author Wikidata ID, Author GND ID, Work Wikidata ID, Work Goodreads ID, Work GND ID, DraCor ID).

Publication and premiere dates have been retained as documented in the original encyclopedia without editorial correction. Uncertainty markers (indicated by »(?)« in the source) have not been preserved in this dataset. In cases of multiple dates, the earliest has been adopted. All dates have been normalised to [EDTF](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/) format.

Following the organisational principle of the source volume, works are arranged alphabetically by author surname.
