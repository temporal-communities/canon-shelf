# »Від Сковороди до сьогодення: 100 знакових творів українською мовою«
*(= »From Skovoroda to the Present Day: 100 Notable Books in Ukrainian«)*

»The list […] was compiled in 2019 by members of PEN Ukraine and the online magazine *The Ukrainians* to show the abundance and genre variety of Ukrainian literature and draw attention to significant works which, due to certain reasons, were forgotten or little known.« ([English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Notable_Books_in_Ukrainian))

We transformed the canon into a machine-readable list and enriched it with metadata on authors and works (Author English, Author Wikidata ID, Author GND ID, Title English, Work Wikidata ID, Work Goodreads ID, Work GND ID, Publication Date).

Our list contains 101 books, as we counted »The Awakened Muse / The Enslaved Muse« by Ihor Kalynets as two separate works.

Publication years were taken from the source and verified manually. They were then converted into [EDTF](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/) format. This usually affected multi-volume works published over several years, for which we specified the individual years, i.&nbsp;e. ```1964–1970``` → ```{1964,1966,1970}```.
